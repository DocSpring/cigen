# Minimal CIGen Configuration
# This is the absolute minimum - everything else is auto-detected and auto-configured

providers:
  - github

jobs:
  test:
    packages:
      - ruby
    steps:
      - run: bundle exec rspec
# That's it! CIGen will automatically:
# - Detect Ruby version from .ruby-version or Gemfile
# - Generate `bundle install --deployment` step
# - Cache vendor/bundle with Gemfile.lock key
# - Add checkout step
# - Skip job if app/** and spec/** are unchanged
# - Generate configs for all enabled providers
