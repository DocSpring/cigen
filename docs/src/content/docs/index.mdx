Cigen is a universal CI pipeline configuration generator that allows you to write your CI configuration once in a provider-agnostic format, then generate native configurations for any CI platform.

## Why Cigen?

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Universal Configuration" icon="puzzle">
    Write your CI pipeline once using cigen's universal format. No more
    maintaining separate configurations for different CI providers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Architecture Support" icon="laptop">
    Automatically generate jobs for multiple architectures (amd64, arm64) from a
    single job definition.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Intelligent Caching" icon="rocket">
    Automatic cache key generation and injection based on file dependencies and
    checksums.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Advanced Features" icon="star">
    Built-in workarounds for CI platform limitations like OR dependencies and
    approval job status fixes.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Core Philosophy

**If a CI platform doesn't support a feature we need, we build it ourselves.**

Cigen doesn't just translate configurations - it enhances them. When CircleCI lacks OR dependencies, we implement them with automated approval jobs. When GitHub status updates fail for approval jobs, we fix them with API calls.

## Quick Example

Define your pipeline structure:

```
.cigen/
├── cigen.yml                    # Provider and global config
├── config/
│   └── source_file_groups.yml  # Reusable file patterns
├── workflows/
│   └── main/
│       └── jobs/
│           ├── test.yml         # Test job definition
│           └── build.yml        # Build job definition
```

```yaml title=".cigen/cigen.yml"
provider: circleci
```

```yaml title=".cigen/config/source_file_groups.yml"
source_file_groups:
  nodejs:
    - 'src/**/*.js'
    - 'package.json'
    - 'package-lock.json'
```

```yaml title=".cigen/workflows/main/jobs/test.yml"
image: cimg/node:18.0
source_files: '@nodejs'
packages: node
steps:
  - run: npm test
```

```yaml title=".cigen/workflows/main/jobs/build.yml"
image: cimg/node:18.0
architectures: [amd64, arm64]
requires: [test]
source_files: '@nodejs'
packages: node
steps:
  - run: npm run build
```

Generate native CircleCI configuration:

```bash
cigen generate
```

Results in a complete `.circleci/config.yml` with:

- Git checkout
- Package installation with caching - automatically detects npm, pnpm, yarn, bun, etc.
- Job skipping if files haven't changed
- Separate jobs for each architecture (`build_amd64`, `build_arm64`), or a job matrix on supported providers

## Current Status

Cigen supports:

- **CircleCI** (full support with advanced features)
- **GitHub Actions** (planned)
- **GitLab CI** (planned)
- **Jenkins** (planned)
