## CI Provider Support

### GitHub Actions

Full support for GitHub Actions workflows, including:

- Matrix builds
- Reusable workflows
- GitHub-specific features (caching, artifacts, etc.)
- Environment and deployment support

### Buildkite

Native Buildkite pipeline generation with:

- Dynamic pipelines
- Plugin support
- Agent targeting
- Artifact management

### Jenkins

Jenkins pipeline generation supporting:

- Declarative pipelines
- Jenkinsfile generation
- Plugin integration
- Multi-branch support

## Local Execution

First-class support for running all your CI jobs locally, similar to tools like Taskfile and [act](https://github.com/nektos/act):

- **Docker-based execution** - Run jobs in isolated containers matching your CI environment
- **Native execution** - Run jobs directly on your machine for faster iteration
- **Selective job execution** - Run individual jobs or entire workflows
- **Environment parity** - Use the same configuration for CI and local runs

This enables rapid development and testing without pushing to CI.

## CLI Workflow Management

Interactive CLI tools to manage your CI pipelines:

- **Job status monitoring** - View real-time status of running jobs across providers
- **Log fetching** - Download and view logs for failing jobs
- **Local reproduction** - Automatically re-run failing tests on your machine with the same environment
- **Pipeline control** - Trigger, cancel, or retry jobs from the command line
- **Cross-provider interface** - Unified CLI regardless of which CI provider you use

This brings the power of CI/CD management directly to your terminal.
