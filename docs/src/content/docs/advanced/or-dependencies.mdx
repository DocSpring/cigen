Most CI platforms only support AND dependencies (all requirements must complete). Cigen does not yet provide synthesized OR-dependency shims.

## The Problem

<Aside type="caution">
  **CircleCI Limitation**: Only supports AND dependencies. A job can't run until
  ALL of its required jobs complete.
</Aside>

Consider this common scenario:

- A build job should run when someone manually approves it, OR
- A build job should automatically run when any deployment is triggered

Traditional CircleCI can't express this "either/or" relationship.

## Status

OR-dependencies are on the roadmap. For now, model explicit AND chains or split workflows to approximate OR conditions.

## Workarounds

Where possible, restructure workflows so each path is a separate job chain feeding into a single gate, and use manual approvals strategically.
